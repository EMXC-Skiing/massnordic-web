# The Mass Nordic Program

The Massachusetts Nordic Program, known as Mass Nordic, promotes cross-country ski racing and development of junior athletes in Massachusetts.
Each March, Team Mass competes against some of the best skiers in New England at the NENSA Eastern U16 Championships and the NENSA Eastern High School (EHS) Championships.
Athletes earn their place on Team Mass by racing in the annual Mass Nordic Cup and collecting qualifying points from high school and club races throughout the season.

## 2026 Mass Nordic Cup

The 2026 Mass Nordic Cup will be held Jan. 25, 2026, at Prospect Mountain in Woodford, VT. [Register on SkiReg](https://www.skireg.com/massachusetts-nordic-program-u16-eastern-high-school-qualifier) starting Dec. 1.

## Championship Events

- The U16 Championships and EHS Championships are held on separate weekends in early March, organized by the [New England Nordic Ski Association (NENSA)](https://nensa.net). States from across the Northeast participate.
- Massachusetts takes 24 boys and 24 girls to each event.
- Team selection is primarily based on results from the MA Nordic Cup, held in late January. Other events such as high school league racing and Eastern Cups may also contribute.
- In recent years, the dates of U16 and EHS championships have conflicted with US Ski & Snowboard's Junior National Championships (JNs). Typically, it is impossible for an athlete to participate in both JNs and EHS/U16s.

### Selection Criteria

- Team selection is based on a points system that rewards performance in various races throughout the season -- primarily the Mass Nordic Cup, which all skiers must register for. Points may also be earned via performances in:
    1. High School League Races (public and private).
    2. Championship Races (MIAA & NEPSAC).
    3. Eastern Cups.
- Invitations to the U16 and EHS teams are issued on the Tuesday after the final Eastern Cup race of the season.

For more information on how points and ranking lists are calculated, see [About MA Nordic Points]({% link mass-nordic-points/about.md %}).

### Eligibility
- Any U16 athlete living or going to school in MA is eligible for U16 Championships.
- Any high-school athlete (grade 9-12) living or going to school in MA is eligible for EHS Championships.
-  Only athletes who have registered for the MA Nordic Cup are considered for team selection.

## Mass Nordic Cup

The Mass Nordic Cup is the primary means of qualifying for a championship team. It is held on a single day annually in late January and includes both skate and classic races. Outside of extenuating circumstances such as illness or injury, athletes attempting to qualify for a championship team are expected to race in the Mass Nordic Cup.
