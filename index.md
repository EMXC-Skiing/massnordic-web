# About Mass Nordic

For information on how points and ranking lists are calculated, see [About MA Nordic Points]({% link mass-nordic-points/about.md %}).

## Championship Events

- The U16 Championships and EHS Championships are held on separate weekends in early March, organized by the New England Nordic Ski Association (NENSA). States from across the Northeast participate.
- Massachusetts takes 24 boys and 24 girls to each event.
- Team selection is primarily based on performance in the MA Nordic Cup, held in late January. Performance in other events such as high school league racing and Eastern Cups may also contribute.
- In recent years, the dates of U16 and EHS championships have conflicted with US Ski & Snowboard's Junior National Championships (JNs). Typically, it is impossible for an athlete to participate in both JNs and EHS/U16s.

### Eligibility
- Any U16 athlete living or going to school in MA is eligible for U16 Championships.
- Any high-school athlete (grade 9-12) living or going to school in MA is eligible for EHS Championships.
-  Only athletes who have registered for the MA Nordic Cup are considered for team selection.

### Team Selection

- Invitations to the U16 and EHS teams are issued after the final Eastern Cup of the season.
- Team selection is based on a **points system** that rewards performance in various races throughout the season. Points may be earned at the following events:
    - The **Mass Nordic Cup** (all skiers must register for this event).
    - **High School League Races** (public and private).
    - **Championship Races** (MIAA & NEPSAC).
    - **Eastern Cups**.
- Coaches report race results to the MA Nordic Committee for the purpose of point calculation. The dataset of race results is viewable [here](https://app.hex.tech/70f48122-c26b-4657-9a9c-f117cb78c48a/app/61a8b3dd-f74a-4b84-bee3-2041395ea866/latest).


## Mass Nordic Cup

The Mass Nordic Cup is the flagship qualification event. It is held on a single day annually in late January and includes both skate and classic races. Outside of extenuating circumstances such as illness or injury, athletes attempting to qualify for a championship team are expected to race in the Mass Nordic Cup.

## The Mass Nordic Program

### Mass Nordic Committee
