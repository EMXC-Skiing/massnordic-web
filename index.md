# Mass Nordic

### **Program description**

The Massachusetts Nordic Program, known as Mass Nordic, represents Massachusetts at the Eastern US U16 Championship and the EHS (Eastern High School) Championship in March, with a separate team for each event. The championship events include teams from NY, VT, ME, NH, CT and RI. At the U16 event, a team frequently travels from the Midwest as well.

U16 team includes 24 boys and 24 girls that compete at the U16 Championship on the second weekend in March.

EHS team includes 24 boys and 24 girls in grades 9-12, not restricted by age. The date of EHS conflicts with Junior Nationals (JNs), so JN athletes do not participate in EHS.

### **Who participates?**

U16 team: any Nordic skier that fits into the USSA U16 category. They can be part of a middle school team, HS team, club team, or unattached.

EHS team: any Nordic skier in grades 9, 10, 11, or 12\. They can be part of a HS team, club team, or unattached.

As an EMXC program, even though Mass Nordic includes other athletes and coaches, all coaches and athletes over 18 must be background checked and have participated in SafeSport through US Ski and Snowboard. See our [***SafeSport***](https://emxc.org/resources/safesport-compliance) page for details.

### **How are racers selected?**
