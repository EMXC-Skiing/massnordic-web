# The Mass Nordic Program

The Massachusetts Nordic Program, known as Mass Nordic, is an umbrella organization bringing together athletes, coaches, and clubs to support junior cross-country ski racing across the state.
Our goal is to make high-quality racing and training accessible to all Massachusetts high school skiers, while also preparing Team MA to compete at the Eastern High School and U16 Championships each March.
Through organizing the annual MA Nordic Cup and maintaining the MA Ranking List, we provide fair, statewide racing opportunities for all high schoolâ€“aged skiers and set a clear pathway for team selection.
We also organize the Team MA trips to EHS and U16s and work closely with NENSA and community partners to strengthen racing and development opportunities across the state.

## 2026 MA Nordic Cup

The 2026 MA Nordic Cup will be held Jan. 25, 2026, at Prospect Mountain in Woodford, VT. [Register on SkiReg](https://www.skireg.com/massachusetts-nordic-program-u16-eastern-high-school-qualifier) starting Dec. 1.

## Championship Events

- The U16 Championships and EHS Championships are held on separate weekends in early March, organized by the [New England Nordic Ski Association (NENSA)](https://nensa.net). States from across the Northeast participate.
- Massachusetts takes 24 boys and 24 girls to each event.
- Team selection is primarily based on results from the MA Nordic Cup, held in late January. Other events such as high school league racing and Eastern Cups may also contribute.
- In recent years, the dates of U16 and EHS championships have conflicted with US Ski & Snowboard's Junior National Championships (JNs). Typically, it is impossible for an athlete to participate in both JNs and EHS/U16s.

### Selection Criteria

- Team selection is based on a points system that rewards performance in various races throughout the season -- primarily the MA Nordic Cup, which all skiers must register for. Points may also be earned via performances in:
    1. High School League Races (public and private).
    2. Championship Races (MIAA & NEPSAC).
    3. Eastern Cups.
- Invitations to the U16 and EHS teams are issued on the Tuesday after the final Eastern Cup race of the season.

For more information on how points and ranking lists are calculated, see [About MA Nordic Points]({% link mass-nordic-points/about.md %}).

### Eligibility
- Any U16 athlete living or going to school in MA is eligible for U16 Championships.
- Any high-school athlete (grade 9-12) living or going to school in MA is eligible for EHS Championships.
-  Only athletes who have registered for the MA Nordic Cup are considered for team selection.

## MA Nordic Cup

The MA Nordic Cup is the primary means of qualifying for a championship team. It is held on a single day annually in late January and includes both skate and classic races. Outside of extenuating circumstances such as illness or injury, athletes attempting to qualify for a championship team are expected to race in the MA Nordic Cup.
