# The Mass Nordic Program

The Massachusetts Nordic Program, known as Mass Nordic, is an umbrella organization bringing together athletes, coaches, and clubs to support junior cross-country ski racing across the state.
Our goal is to make high-quality racing and training accessible to all Massachusetts high school skiers, while also preparing Team MA to compete at the Eastern High School and U16 Championships each March.
Through the annual MA Nordic Cup and the MA Ranking List, we provide accessible, statewide racing opportunities and set a clear pathway for team selection.
We also lead the Team MA trips to EHS and U16s and work closely with NENSA and community
partners to strengthen racing and development statewide.

## Points and Ranking List

{: .update }
Skiers who competed in the 2026 MA Nordic Cup should ensure they complete at least one scored skate race in the '25-'26 season. The [Race for Snow 5k](https://www.skireg.com/raceforsnow2026) at Weston Ski Track on Sat., Jan 31,  and Mathias Race at Mount Greylock Regional School on Sun, Feb. 1, are open to all skiers and will be scored for skate points. Other scored skate races include Eastern Cups and MIAA and NEPSAC league races and championships.

With the completion of the MA Nordic Cup, the MA Ranking List will go live on this website the week of Jan. 26.
