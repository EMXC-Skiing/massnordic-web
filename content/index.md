# The Mass Nordic Program

The Massachusetts Nordic Program, known as Mass Nordic, is an umbrella organization bringing together athletes, coaches, and clubs to support junior cross-country ski racing across the state.
Our goal is to make high-quality racing and training accessible to all Massachusetts high school skiers, while also preparing Team MA to compete at the Eastern High School and U16 Championships each March.
Through the annual MA Nordic Cup and the MA Ranking List, we provide accessible, statewide racing opportunities and set a clear pathway for team selection.
We also lead the Team MA trips to EHS and U16s and work closely with NENSA and community
partners to strengthen racing and development statewide.

## MA Nordic Cup

The **2026 MA Nordic Cup** will be held Sun, Jan. 25, 2026, at Prospect Mountain in Woodford, VT.
[Registration via SkiReg](https://www.skireg.com/massachusetts-nordic-program-u16-eastern-high-school-qualifier) opens Dec. 1.

## EHS & U16 Championships

Team MA fields teams of 24 girls and 24 boys at each of
[EHS Championships]({% link ehs-championships.md %}) and [U16 Championships]({% link u16-championships.md%}) every March.
