# The Mass Nordic Program

The Massachusetts Nordic Program, known as Mass Nordic, is an umbrella organization bringing together athletes, coaches, and clubs to support junior cross-country ski racing across the state.
Our goal is to make high-quality racing and training accessible to all Massachusetts high school skiers, while also preparing Team MA to compete at the Eastern High School and U16 Championships each March.
Through the annual MA Nordic Cup and the MA Ranking List, we provide accessible, statewide racing opportunities and set a clear pathway for team selection.
We also lead the Team MA trips to EHS and U16s and work closely with NENSA and community
partners to strengthen racing and development statewide.

## MA Nordic Cup

The [2026 MA Nordic Cup]({% link ma-nordic-cup/index.md %}) is Sun, Jan. 25, 2026, at Prospect Mountain in Woodford, VT. **Skiers must register for this race to be considered for the U16 or EHS Championship teams**. Skiers who wish to be considered but are unable to participate in the race may apply for a waiver through their coach, but are still required to register. See <a href="{% link points/about.md %}#eligibility">Eligibility</a> for details.
