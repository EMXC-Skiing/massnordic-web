# Qualifying for Team MA

This page provides key details that athletes and families should understand about how to qualify for U16s and EHS.

For information on coach roles and responsibilities, see the [Coaches' Guide]({% link qualification/coaches-guide.md %}).

For complete details of the qualification system, see the [Technical Reference]({% link qualification/technical-reference.md %}).

## At a glance

The MA Nordic Points system is designed to answer one question: *how strong is a skier’s body of racing across the season, with special weight given to racing against the full statewide field at the MA Nordic Cup?*

Mass Nordic pairs a single day of statewide racing (the MA Nordic Cup) with a points-based system that also incorporates racing from high school leagues and Eastern Cups. Points are aggregated into a single MA Ranking List, which forms the foundation for championship team selection.

### Step-by-step breakdown

The first step to be eligible for the U16 or EHS Championship teams is to register for the [MA Nordic Cup]({% link ma-nordic-cup/index.md %}).

Registered skiers are expected to race in the MA Nordic Cup. Athletes with a pre-approved waiver to miss one or both races at the Cup should plan to complete additional racing during the season (see “Waivers” below).

Skiers may also participate in other scored skate and classic races, such as high school races and Eastern Cups.

Most team spots are filled based on the MA Ranking List (MRL), which combines a skier's MA Nordic Cup performance with their best other scored races. A small number of additional spots are filled through discretionary selection by the MA Nordic Board.

## The MA Nordic Cup

The MA Nordic Cup is the central pillar of qualification for U16 and EHS teams. It provides a common reference point where skiers from different programs and leagues are evaluated under the same conditions.

To be eligible for team naming, skiers must register for and compete in the MA Nordic Cup unless a waiver is approved in advance. Even skiers with an approved waiver must still register for the MA Nordic Cup.

The MA Nordic Cup includes one scored classic race and one scored skate race. Completing the full Cup alone is sufficient to meet the racing requirements for championship team selection.

## Earning MA Nordic Points

Skiers earn MA Nordic Points by racing in:

* The MA Nordic Cup and other statewide races administered by Mass Nordic
* Public and private varsity high school league races
* State Championships (MIAA and NEPSAC)
* Eastern Cups

Any registered high school or U16 skier who finishes a points-eligible race earns MA Nordic Points for that race.

## The MA Ranking List (MRL)

The MA Ranking List ranks skiers based on an aggregate of the MA Nordic Points they earn over the season. Points are tracked separately for classic and skate races and then combined. Lower points indicate better performances.

To appear on the MRL, a skier must complete at least one scored classic race and one scored skate race. Skiers who do not meet this requirement do not appear on the list.

The MRL is designed to reflect the quality of a skier’s performances rather than the quantity of races entered, while rewarding strong results at the MA Nordic Cup.

The MRL is published on massnordic.org after the MA Nordic Cup and updated at least weekly through the end of the Eastern Cup season. The final list used for team selection is published after the last Eastern Cup weekend.

## How teams are named

Four teams are named each season: U16 Boys, U16 Girls, EHS Boys, and EHS Girls. Each team has 24 total spots.

* 20 objective spots are filled in order of placement on the MRL.
* 4 discretionary spots are reserved for selection in the judgment of the MA Nordic Board.

If a skier declines an objective spot, that spot is offered to the next eligible skier on the MRL.

## Waivers

In specific cases, skiers may request a waiver to excuse participation in the MA Nordic Cup while remaining eligible for team selection. Waivers must be submitted by a coach before the MA Nordic Cup.

Waivers may be granted for:

* Illness or injury on the day of the event
* Family commitments that prevent participation (other extracurricular activities generally do not qualify)
* Athletes on track or close to qualifying for Junior Nationals, under defined criteria

Skiers with approved waivers may still qualify for teams through the MRL if they complete at least one scored race in each technique at other eligible events. Skiers who do not earn points in both techniques may only be considered through discretionary selection.
