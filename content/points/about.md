# MA Nordic Points for EHS & U16s Qualification

## Motivation

The purpose of the points system is to promote objectivity and transparency in how athlete performance factors into championship team selection.
The system preserves the central role of the MA Nordic Cup in naming championship teams while also rewarding athletes for strong performances in races outside of the MA Nordic Cup.

## At a glance

**MA Nordic Cup:**
Only athletes who race in the MA Nordic Cup or receive a waiver to skip it may qualify for a championship team.

**Earning MA Nordic Points:**
Skiers earn MA Nordic Points by racing in various race series and championships beyond the MA Nordic Cup, including high school league races, state championships, and Eastern Cups.

**Team selection:**
The MA Ranking List (MRL) ranks skiers by an aggregate of the points they earn over the course of the season. Performance in the MA Nordic Cup is an important contributor to placement on the MRL.

**Objective and discretionary slots:**
Twenty skiers of each gender are named to each championship team in order of placement on the MRL. An additional four skiers of each gender may be named to each championship team at the discretion of the MA Nordic selection committee.

**Timeline:**
The MRL is available online following the MA Nordic Cup and is updated at least weekly. Team selection and naming are based on the final version of the MRL and occur after the conclusion of the final Eastern Cup weekend.

## Eligibility

### Registering for the MA Nordic Cup

To qualify for the EHS or U16 Championship teams, skiers must register for and compete in the MA Nordic Cup. In specific cases, skiers may request a waiver to excuse their participation while remaining eligible for team selection.

### Requesting a waiver

If a skier is unable to race in the MA Nordic Cup, they may still be eligible for team selection by obtaining a waiver. Waiver requests must be submitted in advance by the skier’s coach and may be granted for the following reasons:

1. Illness or injury on the day of the event.  
2. Family commitments that prevent participation (Note: Other extracurricular activities generally do not qualify). Any such prior commitments should be communicated to Mass Nordic Committee via a coach-submitted waiver as soon as possible.
3. Junior Nationals qualification expectations, if:  
   * The athlete would qualify for the New England Junior National team as a U18/U20 based on the NENSA Junior Ranking List (JRL) within the week prior to the MA Nordic Cup.  
   * The athlete is "on the bubble," meaning they are among the top three remaining Massachusetts skiers on the U18/U20 JRL after excluding those who would already qualify for Junior Nationals.

*Submitting a waiver request does not guarantee the athlete a spot on a team.* The Mass Nordic Committee reviews all requests promptly and informs the athlete and their coach of the decision.

### How to qualify with an approved waiver

Skiers with approved waivers may be selected for a championship team on either objective criteria (via the MRL) or discretionary grounds, depending on the other races they have entered. 

* Skiers who have earned points from at least one classic and one skate race among the list of points-eligible events are included on the MRL and are eligible for selection based on their ranking on the list.
* Skiers who have not earned both classic and skate points in the season are not included on the MRL and can only be considered for team selection through a discretionary pick by the Mass Nordic Committee.

## Earning points

### Which races earn points

MA Nordic Points may be earned at any of the following races and race series:

1. MA Nordic Cup and any other statewide races administered by Mass Nordic
2. Public and private varsity high school league races (MA Bay East, MA Bay West, Berkshire, Lake Region)  
3. State Championships (MIAA & NEPSAC)  
4. Eastern Cups

### Who earns points

All high school and U16 skiers registered for the MA Nordic Cup in a given season earn MA Nordic Points for their racing in that season.

### When points are calculated

The MRL is maintained and updated in the period following the MA Nordic Cup and ending shortly after the final Eastern Cup weekend. During this period, the most recent MRL is available for review at massnordic.org.

Points are calculated for all points-eligible races a skier has finished in the current season, including retroactively for points-eligible races that occurred before the MA Nordic Cup.

### How points are calculated

Any registered skier who finishes a points-eligible race earns points in that race. Lower points indicate better performances. A skier’s points from a race depend on two factors:

1. The *race penalty,* which reflects the strength of the field, determines the top MA finisher’s points. The race penalty is calculated using a statistical procedure based on past results from the top 5 Massachusetts finishers in the race. Stronger fields yield lower race penalties.  
2. Points for other racers are determined via their *fractional time back* from the top MA finisher (the ratio of the skier’s time to the top MA finisher’s time). A skier’s points are awarded in direct proportion to their fractional time back from the top MA finisher.

Example: If the race penalty of a points-eligible race is 100, then the top MA finisher would score 100 points, and a skier whose time is 5% back from that of the top MA finisher would score 105 points.

### Calculation of the MRL

<!-- ![Diagram illustrating MA Ranking List calculation from points](../assets/images/mrl_aggregation_diagram.png "Diagram illustrating MA Ranking List calculation from points.") -->

Points are calculated separately for classic and skate races. The classic and skate averages are added together to form a skier’s overall points total. The formula is the same for each technique.

**If the skier raced in the MA Nordic Cup in a given technique:**

1. MA Nordic Cup points are always included in the final calculation and form a ceiling for the skier's point average in that technique.
2. Up to three additional eligible races with better points than the skier’s MA Nordic Cup points may additionally be included.
3. MA Nordic Cup points are used as placeholders if the skier doesn’t have other eligible races with better points.
4. The average of these four numbers—MA Nordic Cup points and the three best other scores (or placeholders)—determines the skier’s overall point average for that technique.

**Note:** No further racing beyond the MA Nordic Cup skate and classic events is required to be named to a championship team.

**If the skier did not race in the MA Nordic Cup in a given technique:**

1. The skier must have an approved waiver to skip the MA Nordic Cup in that technique.
2. The skier’s final score is determined by averaging:
   - The best three races among other eligible events of that technique, or  
   - As many eligible races as the skier has completed, if fewer than three.
3. If a skier has not finished at least one eligible race in each technique, they do not appear on the MRL.

**Note**: At least one classic and one skate race must be completed for inclusion in the MRL. If a skier does not have enough eligible races, their only route onto a championship team is as a discretionary selection.

### Naming the team

For each championship team, twenty slots of each gender are filled in order of placement on the MRL. If a skier declines one of these slots, that slot is offered to the next eligible skier on the MRL.

Up to four team slots of each gender are filled at the discretion of the Mass Nordic Committee.

## For coaches

### How do I submit race results for entry into the MA Nordic results database?

After each race, email the results as an attachment to [**board@massnordic.org**](mailto:board@massnordic.org). 

### How do I submit a waiver on behalf of an athlete who will not be competing in the MA Nordic Cup?

Waiver requests must be submitted by coaches prior to the MA Nordic Cup. Submitting a waiver does not guarantee the athlete a spot on a team. For more details, see the “Eligibility” section above.
