## Introduction

Mass Nordic uses a points-based system to promote objectivity and transparency in the way athlete performance factors into championship team selection.

This document is intended for athletes, parents, and coaches seeking to better understand how teams are named.

Most athletes and families only need to understand the eligibility requirements, the role of the MA Nordic Cup, and how the MA Ranking List (MRL) is used to name teams. Technical details of the points calculation are included for transparency and consistency but are not required knowledge for participation.

## Summary of team selection

This section provides a high-level overview of how eligibility, scoring, ranking, and team selection fit together.

To be eligible for the U16 or EHS championship team, a skier must register for and compete in the MA Nordic Cup, unless a coach-submitted waiver is approved in advance. Over the course of the season, the skier must complete at least one scored classic race and one scored skate race---for example, the MA Nordic Cup, or other eligible events. Results from these races are converted into MA Nordic Points and combined to place the skier on the MA Ranking List (MRL). Most team spots are filled in order from the MRL, with a small number of additional spots reserved for discretionary selection by the Mass Nordic Board.

### Key components

**MA Nordic Cup:**
The MA Nordic Cup is the central pillar of qualification for an EHS or U16 championship team. It provides a common reference point where skiers from different programs and leagues are evaluated under the same conditions. To be eligible for team naming, skiers must compete in the MA Nordic Cup or obtain a waiver to miss it.

**Earning MA Nordic Points:**
Skiers earn MA Nordic Points by racing in the MA Nordic Cup and in other designated statewide and regional races, including high school league races, state championships, and Eastern Cups.

**MA Ranking List (MRL):**
The MRL ranks skiers based on an aggregate of the MA Nordic Points they earn over the course of the season. Points are tracked separately for classic and skate races and combined to produce an overall ranking. Skiers who demonstrate their preparedness for championship events by completing at least one scored race in each technique appear on the MRL. The MRL is designed to reflect the quality of a skier’s performances rather than the quantity of races entered, while rewarding strong results at the MA Nordic Cup.

**Team selection:**
Team selection combines objective ranking with limited discretionary selection. Of the 24 available slots per team, 20 skiers are named to each championship team in order of placement on the MRL. An additional 4 skiers may be named to each championship team at the discretion of the MA Nordic Board.

**Timeline:**
The MRL is published online following the MA Nordic Cup and updated at least weekly. The final MA Ranking List used for team selection is published after the conclusion of the last Eastern Cup weekend. Petitions for discretionary selection must be submitted by the following Monday. Team naming follows shortly thereafter.

## Eligibility

### Registering for the MA Nordic Cup

To qualify for the EHS or U16 Championship teams, skiers must register for and compete in the MA Nordic Cup. In specific cases, skiers may request a waiver to excuse their participation while remaining eligible for team selection. *Even skiers with an approved waiver must register for the MA Nordic Cup.*

### Requesting a waiver

Waivers are intended to preserve eligibility when participation in the MA Nordic Cup is not possible. Waiver requests must be submitted by the skier’s coach prior to the MA Nordic Cup and may be granted for the following reasons:

1. Illness or injury on the day of the event.  
2. Family commitments that prevent participation. Any such prior commitments should be communicated to Mass Nordic Board via a coach-submitted waiver as soon as possible.  (Note: Other extracurricular activities generally do not qualify).
3. Junior Nationals qualification expectations, if:  
   * The athlete would qualify for the New England Junior National team as a U18/U20 based on the NENSA Junior Ranking List (JRL) within the week prior to the MA Nordic Cup.  
   * The athlete is "on the bubble," meaning they are among the top three remaining Massachusetts skiers on the U18/U20 JRL after excluding those who would already qualify for Junior Nationals.

The Mass Nordic Board reviews all requests promptly and informs the athlete and their coach of the outcome.

### How to qualify with an approved waiver

Skiers with approved waivers may be selected for a championship team either on objective criteria (via the MRL) or on discretionary grounds, depending on their other eligible racing. 

A skier who earns MA Nordic Points from at least one scored classic race and one scored skate race at points-eligible events is included on the MRL and is eligible for selection based on their ranking on that list. A skier who does not earn points in both techniques does not appear on the MRL and may only be considered for team selection through one of the discretionary slots.

## Earning points

### Which races earn points

MA Nordic Points may be earned at any of the following races and race series:

1. MA Nordic Cup and any other statewide races administered by Mass Nordic
2. Public and private varsity high school league races (MA Bay East, MA Bay West, Berkshire, Lake Region)  
3. State Championships (MIAA & NEPSAC)  
4. Eastern Cups

### Who earns points

All high school and U16 skiers registered for the MA Nordic Cup in a given season earn MA Nordic Points for their racing in that season.

### When and where points are published

MA Nordic Points are calculated centrally by Mass Nordic using race results submitted by event organizers and coaches.

The MRL is maintained and updated in the period following the MA Nordic Cup and ending shortly after the final Eastern Cup weekend. During this period, the most recent MRL is available for review at massnordic.org.

Points are calculated for all points-eligible races a skier has finished in the current season, including retroactively for points-eligible races that occurred before the MA Nordic Cup.

Athletes and coaches are encouraged to review the published MA Ranking List for accuracy. Questions or corrections regarding posted results should be directed to the Mass Nordic Board as soon as possible. Reasonable efforts will be made to resolve verified errors prior to final team selection.

### How points are calculated

Any registered skier who finishes a points-eligible race earns points in that race. Lower points indicate better performances. In direct analogy to the FIS points system, three components determine a skier's points in a scored race:

1. The *field strength*, which establishes the points earned by the top scored finisher’s points. The race penalty is calculated using a statistical procedure based on past results from the top 5 scored finishers in the race. Stronger fields yield lower race penalties.  
2. The *spread factor*, which is an adjustment for race formats that tend to spread out or compress the field.
3. The *relative time back* from the top scored finisher (the ratio of the skier’s time to the top scored finisher’s time). A skier’s points are awarded in direct proportion to their fractional time back from the top scored finisher.

A skier's awarded points in a race is equal to the race's field strength plus the product of the race's spread factor and the skier's relative time back.


## MA Ranking List and team selection

### Calculation of the MRL

Points are calculated separately for classic and skate races. The classic and skate averages are added together to form a skier’s overall points total. The formula is the same for each technique.

**If the skier raced in the MA Nordic Cup in a given technique:**

1. MA Nordic Cup points are always included in the final calculation and form a ceiling for the skier's point average in that technique.
2. Up to three additional eligible races with better points than the skier’s MA Nordic Cup points may additionally be included.
3. MA Nordic Cup points are used as placeholders if the skier doesn’t have other eligible races with better points.
4. The average of these four numbers—MA Nordic Cup points and the three best other scores (or placeholders)—determines the skier’s overall point average for that technique.

This approach rewards strong performances at the MA Nordic Cup while allowing skiers to improve their ranking through additional racing without being penalized for weaker results.

{: .highlight }
As the MA Nordic Cup consists of one scored skate race and one scored classic race, no further racing beyond the full MA Nordic Cup is required to be named to a championship team.

**If the skier did not race in the MA Nordic Cup in a given technique:**

1. The skier must have an approved waiver to skip the MA Nordic Cup in that technique.
2. The skier’s final score is determined by averaging:
   - The best three races among other eligible events of that technique, or  
   - As many eligible races as the skier has completed, if fewer than three.
3. If a skier has not finished at least one eligible race in each technique, they do not appear on the MRL.

{: .highlight }
At least one classic and one skate race must be completed for inclusion in the MRL. If a skier does not have enough eligible races, their only route onto a championship team is as a discretionary selection.

### Naming the team

Four teams are named: U16 Boys, U16 Girls, EHS Boys, and EHS Girls. Each team has a total of 24 available slots, divided into 20 objective and 4 discretionary slots.

Objective slots are filled in order of placement on the MRL. If a skier declines one of these slots, that slot is offered to the next eligible skier on the MRL.

Discretionary slots allow the selection committee to account for meaningful performances or circumstances that may not be fully reflected in the ranking list. Coaches may submit petitions to the MA Nordic Board on behalf of individual athletes. Petitions provide additional context for the selection committee but are not required for an athlete to be considered for discretionary selection. The deadline for petitions is the Monday following the final Eastern Cup of the season.
