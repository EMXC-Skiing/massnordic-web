# Points & Ranking Lists

Beginning in the 2024-25 season, Mass Nordic adopted a points-based system to select teams for the Eastern High School (EHS) and U16 Championships.

During the 2025-26 season, the public points ranking will be posted here and updated on a regular basis.

For information on how points and ranking lists are calculated, see [About MA Nordic Points]({% link points/about.md %}).
